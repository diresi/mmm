mmm - mail to mattermost
========================

The idea is to use this helper in postfix transports to post emails to
mattermost instead of dispatching them locally, via smtp or other regular
transports.

Configuration is done in /etc/mmm.toml:

    url="https://mattermost-url/hooks/hook-id"
    username="some name"

Default configuration uses

    url="http://localhost"
    username="$HOSTNAME"


Global configuration is read from /etc/mmm.toml but can be overridden in
$HOME/.mmm.toml.
