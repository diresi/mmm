mmm - mail to mattermost
========================

The idea is to use this helper in postfix transports to post emails to
mattermost instead of dispatching them locally, via smtp or other regular
transports.

Posting is done to preconfigured URLs of Mattermost's incoming webhooks.
https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/incoming/#create-an-incoming-webhook

Configuration is done in /etc/mmm.toml:

    url="https://mattermost-url/hooks/hook-id"
    username="some name"

Default configuration uses

    url="http://localhost"
    username="$HOSTNAME"


Global configuration is read from /etc/mmm.toml but can be overridden in
$HOME/.mmm.toml.
